***Adaptive Modulation Scheme Selection*** 

This project demonstrates the selection of adaptive modulation schemes based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values. The SNR values are plotted on a graph with a color gradient transitioning from red to green as the SNR increases.

Features-
Adaptive Modulation: Selects modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM) based on SNR values.
Color Gradient Plot: Visualizes SNR values with a color gradient from red to green.
Usage

Install Dependencies:
pip install numpy matplotlib
Run the Script:
python adaptive_modulation.py

Code Overview
adaptive_mod(snr): Function to determine the modulation scheme based on SNR.
Color Gradient: Uses plt.cm.RdYlGn to create a color gradient for the plot.

## 📊 Projects

### 📡 Modulation vs SNR

- **Description:**  
  Visualizes the relationship between modulation schemes and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values.
  
- **Key Libraries:**  
  - 📌 `pandas` → Data manipulation  
  - 📌 `matplotlib` → Data visualization  
  - 📌 `numpy` → Numerical operations

- **Run It:**
  ```bash
  python Modulation_vs_SNR/modulation_vs_snr.py
  ```

---

### ⏳ Latency vs Time

- **Description:**  
  Analyzes log data to plot latency trends over time, helping identify performance bottlenecks.
  
- **Key Libraries:**  
  - 📌 `pandas` → Data handling  
  - 📌 `matplotlib` → Graph plotting

- **Run It:**
  ```bash
  python Latency_vs_Time/latency_vs_time.py
  ```

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning Predictions

- **Description:**  
  Leverages machine learning algorithms to predict network performance and optimize telecom operations.
  
- **Key Libraries:**  
  - 📌 `scikit-learn` → Machine learning models  
  - 📌 `pandas` → Data processing  
  - 📌 `numpy` → Numerical computations  
  - 📌 `matplotlib` → Visualization

- **Run It:**  
  Detailed instructions are provided in the `ML_Predictions` folder.
